/* Note:
The curly braces {} marks the begining and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, Which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).


Don't Worry too much about System,out and println(). just know that you need them  together to print stuff to the screen.


You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;). */
