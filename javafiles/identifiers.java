/* Java Identifiers

All java Variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
identifiers can be a short names or like a descriptive names 
note: it is recommended to maintain the descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:




The general rules for naming variables are:

  	-> Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
	-> Names must begin with a letter
	-> Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
 	-> Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
 	-> Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
	-> Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
